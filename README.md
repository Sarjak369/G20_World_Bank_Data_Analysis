# G20_World_Bank_Data_Analysis

This is an end-to-end data analytics project. I have used world bank economic and social data to build insights on G20 Countries. I have used wbdata web api protocols to collect data from World Bank website then performed some data transformation and cleaning in pandas.
Later, I created some amazing visualizations in the form of different charts and dashboards on Tableau.
